# :mortar_board: Mock interview questions for junior developers

I sometimes run mock interviews for junior developers and here are some of the questions I ask.
Some of these questions are more advanced than a junior level but I think it's always good to be exposed to unknown terms & concepts, even if it's to simply get comfortable with saying **"I don't know"** :).

They may not be asked in a real interview and may not be expected of you as a junior/grad but:

1.  We never know.
2.  The more you know, the better! :)

Some of these questions link to a README with an explanation.

I'll keep updating this list as I learn more myself and feel free to contribute and add extra questions by submitting a pull request. See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more detailed information.

* (Roleplay) You've come across an error that doesn't have an obvious solution while writing a program, explain what steps you would take in trying to resolve it.

# :gear: General Techniques

* If you find yourself getting lost during coding exercises, try splitting your solution into two parts: Sketch out the solution in any way that makes sense to you (e.g. pseudo-code or natural language), then code that solution. This technique can let you focus on solving separately from coding and spread out the cognitive load.
