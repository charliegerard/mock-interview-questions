# :mortar_board: Mock interview questions for junior developers

I sometimes run mock interviews for junior developers and here are some of the questions I ask.
Some of these questions are more advanced than a junior level but I think it's always good to be exposed to unknown terms & concepts, even if it's to simply get comfortable with saying **"I don't know"** :).

They may not be asked in a real interview and may not be expected of you as a junior/grad but:

1) We never know.
2) The more you know, the better! :)

Some of these questions link to a README with an explanation.

I'll keep updating this list as I learn more myself and feel free to contribute and add extra questions by submitting a pull request. See the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more detailed information.
